# Welcome to Rimble  
Rimble is a set of adaptable components and design standards to help you get your decentralized application off the ground, fast. 

Within you'll find documentation and design guidelines for most standard UI components plus some you'll need in a Web 3.0 world. Your tech stack and workflow are yours to decide. We impose as few constraints as possible.

Alongside our UI components, we're also building a demo app to showcase how you can plug these components into Web 3.0 technologies.

It currently covers:
