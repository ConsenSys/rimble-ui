# Blockie documentation

The `Blockie` component allows for use of [Ethereum blockies](https://github.com/ethereum/blockies) in your app.
Blockies are identicons for Ethereum addresses. These are not meant to replace user profiles, but as security icons, to allow the user to more easily check if an address he wants to interact with is the correct one.

**Import component**
```jsx
import { Blockie } from 'rimble-ui'
```
