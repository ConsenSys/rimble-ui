# Form documentation

The `Form` component provides a wrapped version of the HTML `<form>` element.

## Native HTML5 form validation

For native HTML form validationâ€“available in all our supported browsers, the `:valid` and `:invalid` pseudo selectors are used to apply validation styles as well as display feedback messages.

Rimble scopes the `:valid` and `:invalid` styles to parent `.was-validated` class, usually applied to the Form (you can use the validated prop as a shortcut). Otherwise, any required field without a value shows up as invalid on page load. This way, you may choose when to activate them (typically after form submission is attempted).

**Import component**

```jsx
import { Form } from 'rimble-ui';
```

<!-- STORY -->

### Component props

`Form` will pass any props that are defined on its component and uses the following:

| Name      | Type | Default | Description                                                                                |
| --------- | ---- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| validated | bool | false   | Sets the validated property of the form which adds a 'was-validated' class to the element. |

### Styled-system props

`Form` uses all the style props from [`Box`](https://consensys.github.io/rimble-ui/?path=/story/components-layout-box--documentation).
