# Heading design guidelines
Use the `Heading` component to give users scannable titles on your interface. A user should be able to understand what a page is for just by reading the headings. This components extends the [`Text`](https://consensys.github.io/rimble-ui/?path=/story/text--default) component to provide default heading styles for H1-H6.
