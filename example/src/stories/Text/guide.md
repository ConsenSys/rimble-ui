# Text design guidelines

Use the `Text` component for copy. Remember to keep your writing as simple as possible, particularly in the blockchain world. Also, bear in mind users are prone to scanning content, so use small chunks of text broken up by headings to make your text more useful.

<!-- STORY -->
